            <p class="about2"> Shushen Herbals is the brainchild of Dr Anil Agrawal, who established the brand in 1994
                at Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh. He cured many Jain priests at the very beginning of his career. Their pure
                and simple lifestyle further promoted the importance of pure, grounded ingredients in Ayurveda. Hence,
                the quality of ingredients is the secret to our success. We have cultivated authentic, unadulterated
                sources of ingredients over the years, and we continue to cultivate them in an increasingly polluted
                world. Dr Anil Agrawal personally supervises the production process of all syrups, kadhas, capsules,
                etc. Shushen Herbal is an Ayurvedic Company Approved by the WHO-GMP and Ayush Ministry. With an
                experience of more than 25 years and more than 2 lakh loyal customers nationwide, we are one of the
                pioneers in the modern-day Ayurveda industry in India.</p>
